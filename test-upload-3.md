# Test Document Upload #3 - CACHE FIX TEST

This is the THIRD test markdown document to verify that the cache invalidation fix works correctly.

## Cache Invalidation Fix Applied

The pattern has been corrected from:
- ❌ OLD: `*:documents:search:*` 
- ✅ NEW: `*:type:pageddocumentresultdto:documents:search:*`

This should now properly match the L1 cache keys and invalidate them when new documents are uploaded.

## Expected Results

- This document should upload successfully
- The cache should be properly invalidated
- The document count should increase from 11 to 12
- The new document should appear in the collection list immediately
- No more cache hit issues preventing new documents from showing

## Test Status

✅ Upload validation working
✅ Database save working  
✅ R2R processing working
🔄 Cache invalidation fix being tested
🔄 Frontend display being tested

This is the final test to confirm the upload system is fully functional!
