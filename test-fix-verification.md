# Database Transaction Fix Verification

This document is being uploaded to test the fix for the R2R database transaction error.

## Problem Solved
- Fixed NpgsqlRetryingExecutionStrategy conflict with explicit transactions
- Wrapped transaction logic in execution strategy
- Document processing should now complete successfully

## Test Details
- Document ID: Will be generated during upload
- Collection: JWT Authentication Test After Fresh Login
- Expected Result: Successful R2R processing without database errors

## Technical Fix Applied
```csharp
var strategy = context.Database.CreateExecutionStrategy();
await strategy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
{
    using var transaction = await context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();
    // ... transaction logic ...
});
```

This ensures the entire transaction is retriable and compatible with PostgreSQL's retry strategy.
