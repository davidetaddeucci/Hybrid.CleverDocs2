# Test Document Upload #5 - FINAL CACHE PATTERN FIX

This is the FIFTH test markdown document to verify that the cache invalidation pattern fix works correctly.

## Cache Pattern Fix Applied

The cache invalidation pattern has been corrected:
- ❌ OLD: `await _cacheService.InvalidateAsync($"*:type:pageddocumentresultdto:documents:search:*");`
- ✅ NEW: `await _cacheService.InvalidateAsync($"type:pageddocumentresultdto:documents:search:*");`

The GeneratePattern method in CacheKeyGenerator adds the `*` prefix automatically, so we don't need to include it in our pattern.

## Expected Results

- This document should upload successfully
- The cache should be properly invalidated with the correct pattern
- The document count should increase from 11 to 12
- The new document should appear in the collection list immediately
- Cache MISS should occur after invalidation

## Test Status

✅ Upload validation working
✅ Database save working  
✅ R2R processing working
✅ Cache invalidation pattern corrected
✅ Backend restarted with fixes
🔄 Final test in progress

This is the DEFINITIVE test to confirm the upload system is fully functional!
