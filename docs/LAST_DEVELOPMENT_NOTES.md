# Last Development Notes

This document summarizes the current state of development, outstanding compilation issues, implementation progress against all specification documents, and recommended next steps.

## 1. Compilation Status & Blockers
- **RabbitMQ HealthCheck overload**: CS1503 error (string vs. `Func<IServiceProvider, IConnection>`).
- **Stray/orphaned code**: Duplicate `AddHealthChecks()` blocks and leftover `var url = cfg...` lines in `Program.cs`.
- **Duplicate usings**: CS0105 warnings in `Program.cs` and controllers.
- **Nullability warnings (CS8603)**: Client classes returning null without proper annotations.

## 2. Implementation vs Specification
- **System Architecture**: Multi-tenant WebServices and background workers implemented.
- **Auth Flows**: `AuthClient` scaffolded with login/refresh/logout, DI configured.
- **Data Model**: Entity definitions and PostgreSQL `DbContext` configured.
- **RabbitMQ Integration**: MassTransit consumer added for ingestion; health-check wiring pending fix.
- **Redis Caching**: `StackExchangeRedisCache` configured; health-check wiring pending.
- **Scalability & Deployment**: Documentation exists; CI/CD and metrics instrumentation missing.
- **Subproject Docs**: WebUI and WebServices READMEs present; linked in main README.

## 3. Module Implementation Status
| Module             | Status                                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| IngestionClient    | DTO, consumer, background worker implemented ✅ |
| DocumentClient     | Scaffolded, CRUD methods pending               |
| ConversationClient | CRUD methods implemented ✅                    |
| PromptClient       | CRUD methods implemented ✅                    |
| GraphClient        | Scaffolded, batch operations pending           |
| SearchClient       | Scaffolded, vector/hybrid flows pending        |
| ToolsClient        | CRUD methods implemented ✅                    |
| MaintenanceClient  | CRUD methods implemented ✅                    |
| OrchestrationClient| Scaffolded, workflow handlers pending          |
| LocalLLMClient     | Scaffolded, fallback strategy pending          |
| ValidationClient   | Scaffolded, schema enforcement pending         |
| McpTuningClient    | Scaffolded, tuning endpoints pending           |

## 4. Testing & CI/CD Gaps
- No automated unit/integration tests present.
- Missing E2E and load testing suites.
- No CI/CD pipeline definitions (build, test, deploy).
- Swagger/OpenAPI specification not generated.

## 5. Documentation Readiness
- `README.md` updated with high-level overview and TODO links.
- `docs/todo.md` and `docs/to_fix.md` track feature roadmap and pending fixes.
- Detailed architecture and design docs in `docs/` directory.

## 6. Next Steps
1. **Clean up `Program.cs`**:
   - Consolidate to a single `AddHealthChecks()` chain including RabbitMQ.
   - Remove stray code and duplicate usings.
2. **Address nullability**: Annotate or handle potential null returns in client wrappers.
3. **Implement remaining modules**: Complete DTOs, consumers, and workers for all scaffolded clients.
4. **Add tests**: Write unit and integration tests for health-checks, consumers, and clients.
5. **CI/CD & API spec**: Create pipeline definitions and generate Swagger/OpenAPI spec.
6. **Metrics & monitoring**: Integrate Prometheus/Grafana health probes.
