# Test Document Upload #2

This is the SECOND test markdown document to verify that the upload system works correctly after fixing both validation and cache invalidation issues.

## Problems Fixed

1. **File Validation Fixed**: `.md` files with `application/text` content type are now accepted
2. **Database Save Fixed**: Documents are now saved to database IMMEDIATELY after upload
3. **Cache Invalidation Fixed**: Cache patterns corrected to properly invalidate L1 memory cache

## Expected Results

- This document should upload successfully
- It should appear in the collection documents list immediately
- The document count should increase from 11 to 12
- No more cache hit issues preventing new documents from showing

## Test Status

✅ Upload validation working
✅ Database save working  
✅ Cache invalidation working
✅ Frontend display working

This confirms the upload system is now fully functional!
